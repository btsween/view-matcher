The purpose of this project is to allow a user to find matching views from json for user
input selectors

When running, you will be asked to provide the selectors that you are looking to match.
Use the rules below when providing input:

For a class, simply enter the name
  example: Input
For an identifier, start with a #
   example: #container
For a className, start with a .
  example: .container

Multiple selectors can be used at the same time
To do so, seperate selectors by a space
  example Input #container
